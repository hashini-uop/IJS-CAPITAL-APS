                <h2>Agricultural sector</h2>
                <p>The US EPA estimates that 24% of global greenhouse gas emissions are from the agricultural sector,
                    resulting in a loss of ecosystems and 150-200 animal and plant species going extinct every day.
                    Solutions include vertical and indoor farms to increase output, reduce crop susceptibility to pests,
                    and reduce food waste and transportation. Carbon taxes, such as per kilo CO2 emissions on meat
                    products, could help reduce meat consumption.</p>

            <div class="text-col">
                <h2>Energy sector</h2>
                <p> The energy sector accounts for 25% of global emissions, mostly due to energy production and
                    heating/cooling. Smart solutions such as sensors and home automation could save energy consumption.
                    Transportation accounts for 14% of global emissions, with planes, cars and trucks being the worst
                    polluters. Rail is the most carbon efficient mode of transport, with electric, hybrid and hydrogen
                    fuel cell drive trains. Technology is moving in the right direction, but research still lacks
                    hydrogen fuelled ships and trucks.</p>

                <h2>Fast Fashion</h2>
                <p>The production of fast fashion relies on the intensive use of natural resources such as water,
                    energy, and raw materials, and generates significant amounts of waste and pollution. This includes
                    the release of greenhouse gasses during production and transportation, the use of toxic chemicals in
                    textile production, and the disposal of vast amounts of clothing in landfills or incineration,
                    contributing to the global environmental crisis. Use of material that is recyclable and
                    biodegradable Is paramount to the industry.</p>

                <h2>Packaging</h2>
                <p>Single-use plastic items such as bags, straws, and food packaging contribute to plastic waste that
                    can take hundreds of years to decompose, harming wildlife and ecosystems. The production of plastic
                    also relies on non-renewable resources and generates greenhouse gas emissions. To address the
                    plastic and packaging pollution crisis, a shift towards more sustainable and circular systems is
                    needed. Home delivery has increased the carbon footprint.</p>

                <h2>The Oceans</h2>
                <p>The absorption of CO2 by the oceans has led to a process known as ocean acidification. This has had a
                    range of impacts on marine flora and fauna, including Coral bleaching, reduced growth rates and
                    reproductive success in some species, and increased mortality rates in others. In addition the
                    warming of oceans is leading to changes in ocean currents, sea levels, and weather patterns, which
                    can have a range of impacts on marine ecosystems, including altered migration patterns, changes in
                    feeding habits, and the spread of harmful algal blooms.</p>
